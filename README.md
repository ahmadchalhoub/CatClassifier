Welcome to my 'Cat Classifier' Deep Learning project.

In this project, I work through different steps, starting from a single layer, single neuron Logistic Regression
model up to a Deep Fully Connected model that classifies whether an input image is a cat or not.

This was the progressing assignment I worked on during my Deep Learning course.
