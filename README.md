**Welcome to my 'Cat Classifier' Deep Learning project.**

In this project, I work through different steps, starting from a single layer, single neuron Logistic Regression model up to a Deep Fully Connected Neural Network model that classifies whether an input image is a cat or not.

This was the progressing assignment I worked on during my Deep Learning course.




**Run Project Locally**

In order to run the model locally, all that is needed after cloning the repository is to change the path of the training and testing dataset to the paths that correspond to your local machine.
